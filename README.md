## SEO Improvements

To enhance search engine visibility and performance, the following SEO optimizations have been implemented:

*   **Optimized Meta Tags:** The `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and `<meta name="keywords">` tags in `index.html` have been updated with relevant keywords and compelling descriptions to improve search engine ranking and click-through rates.
*   **Minified Assets:** Both `style.css` and `script.js` have been minified to reduce file sizes, leading to faster page load times and improved user experience, which positively impacts SEO.
